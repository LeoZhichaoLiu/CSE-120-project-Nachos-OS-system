Work Summary:

Member: Ruichen Li, Zhichao Liu, Yiming Zhao

We write the codes for 1 to 5 with implementation and tests. We add the
features to Alarm, KThread, Condition2, and GameMatch, allowing the 
functionality of timeinterrupt, waituntil, cancel, join, sleep, wake, 
wakeup, sleepfor, and play in GameMatch. Everything works well as we tested.

Zhichao Liu wrote the basic codes for 1,2,4,5, some tests cases in 1, 2, 4, and revise bugs in 4, 5.

Ruichen Li coded task 1 and 3, and he created most of the tests for task 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
