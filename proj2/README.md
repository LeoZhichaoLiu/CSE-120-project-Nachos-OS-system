Work Summary:

Member: Ruichen Li, Zhichao Liu, Yiming Zhao

We write the codes for 1 to 3 with implementation and tests. We add the features to system call of read(), write(), open(), create(), close(), unlink(), exit(), exec(), join(), allowing the functionality of reading and writing, allocating space for file system and memory sections, transfering between visual and physical memorys, multiprogramming and multiprocessing. Everything works well as we tested. EC part does not have sufficient tests and it may interfere with part 1-3 so we decide not to include it.

For the member contribution:

Zhichao Liu wrote the basic codes for 1, debug and revise the codes for 2 and 3. 

Ruichen Li wrote the basic codes for part 2 and 3, and the test files for part 1.

Yiming Zhao wrote the basic codes for extra credit part.
